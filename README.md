# Portal a garage door application using Raspberry Pi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

## Use Case
If you are absent-minded like me, I tend to leave the house and forget to close my garage door. I also hate keeping those blocky remotes on my person if I'm riding a motorcycle, or sometimes I even lock myself out of the house... What if you could setup a server for a resonable price, easy to install and you can open/close your garage door from anywhere?

## What it does
This Application is meant to be used on your mobile device (i.e., phone, tablet, etc.) as well as a browser on a PC. You can use it to open/close your garage from anywhere. I am currently working on this in such a way that you can add an unlimited number of garages.

## This is a work in progress
This Application is currently a work in progress and is not ready for use in your home just yet. I too want to have this working in my garage.

## Initial Setup of your raspberry pi
This setup requires you to have Ubuntu Arm64 18.04 flavor of linux.

### This application requires the installation of the following:
    - docker, docker-compose

## Setup your node Application.

### To install and run:
`docker-compose up`
